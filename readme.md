You're a gnome working during Christmas at one of the Santa's warehouse. All the presents need to get sorted out, before they can be delivered under the tree and that's your job. Presents are usually sorted out by their size, color, ribbon color or pattern, but beware, the displays change quickly and the number of presents increases!

WARNING: You may have to enable autoplay in your browser for the audio.
